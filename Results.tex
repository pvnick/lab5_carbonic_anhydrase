\section{Data and Results}
Five experiments were performed using a constant amount of carbonic anhydrase and varying concentrations of dipic. For each experiment, several measurements of CA-catalyzed pNPA hydrolysis velocities, $ln \left(\frac{dA}{dt}\right)_{cat}$, were taken using spectrophotometry and plotted against the CA/dipic reaction time. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure \ref{fig:kobs_results}.

\end{figure}

From the descending portions of the plots shown in Figure \ref{fig:kobs_results}, five values of $k_{obs}$ were calculated using the slopes determined by least squares regression. The reciprocals of $k_{obs}$ and $\text{[L]}_0$ (dipic concentration) were plotted against each other, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:kobs_vs_l}.

  \caption{Plot of $\frac{1}{k_{obs}}$ versus $\frac{1}{\text{[L]}_0}$. The slope and intercept of the line passing through these points were determined by least squares regression and used to calculate $K_{EML}$ and $k_d$, demonstrated by Equations \eqref{eqn:samp_calc_keml} and \eqref{eqn:samp_calc_kd} respectively.}\label{fig:kobs_vs_l}
\end{figure}

A least squares regression procedure was performed on the data shown in Figure \ref{fig:kobs_vs_l} to retrieve values for the slope and intercept of the line passing through those points. Equations \eqref{eqn:samp_calc_keml} and \eqref{eqn:samp_calc_kd} show how these were used to calculate $K_{EML}$ and $k_d$. Table \ref{tbl:summary} lists these values and their 95\% confidence intervals, as well as accepted values reported in literature.
