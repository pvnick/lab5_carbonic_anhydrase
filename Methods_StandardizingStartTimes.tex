\subsection{Standardizing start times}
Most pain scores in the data file begin shortly after surgery, with about 80\% starting within two hours post-operation. However, there is a non-trivial subset of patients whose pain score recordings started up to several days after their surgeries, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:start_times}.

In the interest of analyzing pain profiles along a standard post-operation time interval, data was disregarded for those patients whose pain scores were recorded starting more than two hours after their procedure. This operation retained 80\% of the original data set. Figure \ref{fig:start_times_pruned} shows the set of start times less than two hours post-operation.
