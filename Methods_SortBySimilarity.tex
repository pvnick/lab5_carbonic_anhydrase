\subsection{Sorting icons by similarity}
For larger numbers of clusters, it is often useful to determine which clusters are most similar to each other. One option of doing so is to use cosine similarity. For any two clusters $C_{\kappa_1}$ and $C_{\kappa_2}$,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cosine_similarity}
    \begin{split}
    similarity(C_{\kappa_1}, C_{\kappa_2}) &= cos\left(\theta_{C_{\kappa_1}, C_{\kappa_2}}\right) \\
                                           &= \frac{z_{C_1,.} \cdot z_{C_2,.}}{|\!|z_{C_1,.}|\!||\!|z_{C_2,.}|\!|} \\
                                           &= \frac{\sum\nolimits_{m} z_{C_1,m} \times z_{C_2,m} }{ \sum\nolimits_{m} \left(z_{C_1,m}\right)^2 \times \left(z_{C_2,m}\right)^2 }
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Similarity is thus measured along the interval $[1,-1]$, with $1$ being an exact match and $-1$ being exactly opposite. When plotting icons, a cluster is first chosen and the associated icon plotted. Icons for every other cluster are then plotted in descending similarity from left to right, flowing over to subsequent rows.
